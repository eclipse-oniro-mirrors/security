# Private Distributors List

The OpenHarmony community has established a restricted disclosure mailing list distros@openharmony.io to ensure that distributors and large-scale users can work together to fix security vulnerabilities.  
This list is used only for synchronization of vulnerability awareness information, repair information, and disclosure plans. No security issues consultation is provided.  

## Membership Criteria

Enterprises or institutions to be eligible for the distros@openharmony.io should follow:  

1. Comply with the laws and regulations of the country and region where the OpenHarmony community is located.  
2. Services are closely related to OpenHarmony, including downstream distributors of OpenHarmony and customers who use OpenHarmony on a large scale.  
3. A complete vulnerability handling process is in place, which can effectively prevent unnecessary information from being spread and auditable records must be kept for all known security issues received.  
4. Have community development capabilities and actively participate in the OpenHarmony community.  

Application process: Relevant enterprises or institutions apply to the Security Committee, and submit to the Working Committee for final approval after the Security Committee approves the application.  

Note: If the enterprises or institutions stops meeting one or more of these criteria after joining the list, Security Committee will unsubscribe them.
